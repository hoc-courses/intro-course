# Curve Stitching \(Optional\)

In this project you will create a mathematical art design and explore its variations.

This design uses straight lines to make shapes that look curved and is sometimes sewn with thread or drawn on paper. 

Develop an _algorithm_ that will generate the first quadrant of the design and then use _abstraction_ to extend the design to the other quadrants.

Write a Snap_!_ program to generate the design.

Below is a partial table of coordinates for the first quadrant of the design, showing which points on the y-axis are joined to which points on the x-axis.  
![axes with first quadrant of design](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/3-lists/Astrid_img/Q1.png)

| From \(y-axis\) | To \(x-axis\) |
| :--- | :--- |
| \(0, 150\) | \(0, 0\) |
| \(0, 140\) | \(10, 0\) |
| \(0, 130\) | \(20, 0\) |
| ... | ... |
| \(0, 20\) | \(130, 0\) |
| \(0, 10\) | \(140, 0\) |
| \(0, 0\) | \(150, 0\) |

There are many possible approaches to this problem. One approach could use a repeat block adjusting x1,y1 and x2, y2 with each iteration. 

Using the same principles, create a surrounding frame for your design. Both the original curve and the frame are made of four quarter-pictures.

Add another copy of the design slanted at 45Â° as shown below.

You could use the Pythagorean Theorem:

Here are some more variations that employ color and more complex geometric arrangements. Create these and your own variations in Snap_!_.
