# Random Block

We can generate a random number between any two whole numbers using the `random` block:

This block generates numbers with about equal likelihood, and can generate the both the lower and upper bounds that you give it. So, ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28149%29.png) can generate 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

This block \(and others with round edges\) is a **reporter** blockâ€”it _reports_ a value. Use this block inside other blocks that take an input:
