# More Art \(Optional\)

To use our new drawing blocks we're going to create some interesting art work. One more command block will be useful before we start.

**Create a Draw Rectangle Command Block**

Create a command block in the **motion** palette, named **draw rectangle**, that will draw a rectangle with the specified width and length.

#### Prepare for Drawing

In the scripting area, set out a collection of the tools and blocks that may be handy in creating your art work. You can adjust the input values for these blocks as needed as you create your art. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/pthWazhu474?rel=0) shows how to create some overlapping regions and then fill some of them with color.

Make your own art. Explore a few different combinations of shape and color. Take screen shots of your art work and save them so you can share them with the class.

## Random Shapes

To add some randomness to your drawings try using the[ ]()random reporter in your calls to your shape commands:
