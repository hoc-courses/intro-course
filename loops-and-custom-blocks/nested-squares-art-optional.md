# Nested Squares Art \(Optional\)

Build a **nest squares** block that uses a **for loop** block and your **draw square** block to draw nested squares. 

Give it the following input parameters:

* number of squares: how many squares to draw
* initial length: the starting size of the squares
* increase: how much to increase the size of the square on each iteration
