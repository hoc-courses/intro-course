# Draw a Field of Flowers

Draw a field of flowers, and give each flower a different color, size, shape, position, and so forth. Use some of the simple custom blocks you've already written, and write new custom blocks that make use of those simpler blocks to do complicated things.  
  
Use ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2835%29.png) to draw lots of flowers, flowers with lots of petals, and so forth.  
  
Use ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28149%29.png) as much as you can to make the flowers interesting and different.

Here is a custom block \(from someone who went crazy\) to give you some ideas:

### Extra Challenge

Write the code to draw the geometric design shown below.

You can watch this animation to get some ideas.

The entire design is made up of circles. So the first thing to do is to write code that will create a circle. To do this, create a custom block `Draw Circle` via the “Variables” menu “Make a block” option. Hint: A regular polygon with 30 or more sides is a good approximation for a circle.

Now that you can draw a circle, you can generate the Daisy Design by rotating your sprite a bit at the end of each circle drawn. In the design above there are 24 circles. How much must the sprite turn each time a circle is drawn in order to make a full cycle of 360° when all the circles are drawn? Create a custom block `Draw Daisy` to do this.

Extend it further to create these patterns:

Add these flowers to your field of flowers.
