# Draw a Field of Flowers

Draw a field of flowers, and give each flower a different color, size, shape, position, and so forth. Use some of the simple custom blocks you've already written, and write new custom blocks that make use of those simpler blocks to do complicated things.  
  
Use ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2835%29.png) to draw lots of flowers, flowers with lots of petals, and so forth.  
  
The ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28357%29.png)  block generates numbers with about equal likelihood, and can generate the both the lower and upper bounds that you give it. So, ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28149%29.png) can generate 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. This block \(and others with round edges\) is a **reporter** blockâ€”it _reports_ a value. Use this block inside other blocks that take a numeric input:

Use ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28149%29.png) to make the flowers interesting and different.
