# Experiencing Algorithms

We're going to step away from the computer for some activities that your teacher will lead.

1. You'll use numbered cups to explore different ways to search for a number in a list of numbers.
2. You'll think about ways to speed up this process.

Keep in mind the following questions while you are working on this activity:

* What strategies exist for finding a particular number in the fewest number of location checks?
* How many guesses would it take on average to find a number? 
* How many guesses would it take to determine that a number didnâ€™t exist in the list at all?
* How much additional work will it be to find a number if N, the highest numbered cup, were to increase?
