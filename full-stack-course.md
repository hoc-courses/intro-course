# Full Stack Course

## Full Stack Curriculum

The full stack curriculum encompasses a set of technologies that enables an entire web application to be built, including both the client and server components.

The stack that CYF teaches is the MERN Stack, with the addition of the SQL Server component for database access.

The MERN Stack stands for **M**ongoDB **E**xpress **R**eact **N**ode. 

* **M**ongoDB ****is a database that runs on the back-end server.
* **E**xpress ****is a web application framework for building web services on the back-end. 
* **R**eact ****is a front-end library for building UI components. 
* **N**ode.js is a JavaScript runtime environment \(like a web browser\) that allows JavaScript to run on a web server. 

### Why MERN?

* Lots of jobs. It is the most in-demand front-end library/framework. 
* Back-end leverages JavaScript knowledge.
  * Only have to learn one programming language.
  * Web Services are written in JavaScript
  * MongoDB data format based on JavaScript object syntax.

### Fundamentals

Learn the three core technologies upon which every web site depends. The first half of the course will focus on these technologies.

| Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML** | A _mark-up language_ to describe the content of web pages |
| **CSS** | A _stylesheet language_ used to express the presentation of web pages. |
| **JavaScript** | A programming language used for both front-end and back-end development. |

### Front-end Library to Build Web Components 

| Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **React** | An open-source library, built by Facebook, to easily build front-end components for web sites. |

### Back-end Web Technologies

Depending on the interest of the class, we'll continue to build the back-end components of a web site. This component is not necessary to get a job as a Junior Web Developer, but is useful to understand the entire stack of technologies involved in building web site.

| Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Node.js, Express.js** | Tools to build the web API \(Application Programming Interface\) which communicates with the front-end to deliver data back and forth. |
| **MongoDB** | Database to store application data |
