# Composition of Functions

Consider the ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2860%29.png) block definition below:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28161%29.png)

Using similar methodology, your challenge is to make the following blocks work by composing several functions together \(and then maybe a little extra work\):

1. A three-input addition operator that accepts only numbers. ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28262%29.png) 
2. A reporter block named "sum of two smallest" that takes three numbers as inputs, and reports the sum of the two smallest \(the example shown below would report 9\): ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28301%29.png) 
3. A predicate block named "Are any equal?" that compares 3 numbers and returns true if any two are equal to each other \(the example shown below would return true\): ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28140%29.png)
