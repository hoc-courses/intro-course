# Intro Course

Prior to their full course, Code Your Future is using available resources from the web, and have the students use them independently to cover the introductory topics. They just provide mentoring/tutors at weekly workshops to help students through the content when they get stuck.

* Khan Academy - [Intro to JavaScript: Drawing & Animation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming)
* Code.org - [Intro to Programming Course 3](https://studio.code.org/s/course3)
* FreeCodeCamp.org - [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/).

I will use my own curriculum for the content that would prepare students for the Code Your Future Full Stack Web Development Course rather than the course from Khan Academy, Code.org, and FreeCodeCamp.org. 

I think my curriculum will cover the same topics in a more engaging way and will allow me to adapt the curriculum to meet the needs to students completely new to web development, as well as those that have had prior experience.
