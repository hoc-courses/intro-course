# Everybody's Got Algorithms

The word "algorithm" is arguably one of the nerdiest words ever emitted from a human mouth. Fortunately for us, the meaning is far easier to understand than you would first think -- an algorithm is simply a set of steps that allow us to solve a particular problem. In fact, many other careers use algorithms, but have different names for them.

* **Cooks** use or memorize _recipes_ to prepare food.
* **UPS Truck Drivers** have "340 Methods," the UPS handbook for drivers, that describes 340 different _protocols_ that should be followed and how long each one should take.
* **Electricians** follow the same general _steps_ when replacing or adding cabling at different houses.
* **Salesman** often have _scripts_ to follow when making a sales call. The scripts describe how to open the conversation \(and possibly more\) in order to increase the odds of gaining a client.
* **Subway Sandwich Artists** have a _series of signs_ stuck to the inside of the counter that prompt the employees with what should be said.
* **Do-It-Yourself projects** all come with some sort of _instructions_. _Directions_, such as those for assembling a piece of furniture or a Lego kit, are algorithms.

Computer science **algorithms** are conceptual solutions to a problem \(such as sorting a list\), whereas the **implementation** of an algorithm is the actual code that brings the solution to life. The implementations themselves can typically be written in almost any programming language and run on any computer; the concepts behind the algorithm are not affected by these types of conditions, in the same way that the outcome of a well-written recipe should \(hopefully\) not be affected by the cook or kitchen.
