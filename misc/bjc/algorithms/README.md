# Algorithms

## Big Ideas

* Explore how to analyze algorithmic speed and understand various factors that contribute to slow or fast runtimes.
* Explore the implications of a world increasingly controlled by algorithms.

## Activities

* Solidify understanding of what an algorithm is and why they're important to computer science and other fields.
* Gain a basic understanding of why certain algorithms perform better than others.
* There's often more than one way to solve the same problem. Certain solutions will be superior to others, but very often choosing a solution will require evaluating a list of trade-offs relevant to your particular situation.
* Practice implementing algorithms that were discussed verbally.
* Memoization is a technique that can be used for improving the performance of algorithms with repeated calculations at the expense of a higher memory requirement.
* Hiding algorithmic details behind a layer of abstraction makes it easier to upgrade or adjust your implementation in the future.
