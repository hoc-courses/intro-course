# Put Stuff on the Board

Remember the board type we made? Let's start using it to store information.

What is involved in putting something on our board? We need to do TWO things in this block: \(a\) set an item on the board itself, and \(b\) display the change. Let's write `create (object) at (row) (col)`, which will do both of these things for us. We have several objects that we want to be able to place on the board; check out the costumes.

You'll find these blocks helpful:

\(Hint: the idea behind displaying our object is that we should first go to the correct square, switch to the correct costume, and stamp\)

\(Another hint: You can pass variables into the costumes block!\)

Alright, head to the next page when you think you have your answer.

Write the `create (object) at (row) (col)` block as described.
