# Vary Your Tree

Change your tree in the following ways. You should probably try these one at a time, so that you can always tell exactly what edit \(in your script\) relates to changes on the stage.

* Change the turn angle.
* Change the scale factor.
* Change the number of recursive calls.

Tricky Extra Task for Experience:

Try to make your tree command output a more realistic tree. For example, our best is shown below:

![beautiful tree](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/recur/real-tree.jpg)

It is different from what we have done so far because the smaller trees are drawn part way up the trunk, instead of at the top of the trunk, and because the pen color is green for the lowest-level branches \(the `tree1`-like ones\) and brown for the others. You do not have to get it exactly like the picture \(or even close to its level\); just try to make a more realistic-looking tree.

Important: You should make sure that after each call that the sprite is back in the same exact orientation and position as it was on the call before!
