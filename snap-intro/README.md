# Intro to Snap!

Scratch is the visual programming language introduced in the previous video. It was developed at MIT Labs and is targeted toward the K-12 age group to spark an interest in coding.

Snap!, developed at Berkeley, is also a visual programming language, and modeled after Scratch. But it includes new features that allow more advanced computer science topics to be taught while still staying in a visual programming language.

Snap! is currently being used as the programming language for an AP Computer Science course where high school students complete the course, and then are able to take the AP exam to get college credit.

Snap! is also being used for an introductory computer science course at Berkeley, called [The Beauty and Joy of Computing](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/course/cs10_sp21.html). It is that course curriculum which I have used and adapted for this course. We will use Snap! to introduce some basic programming concepts, without having to deal with the complexities of a text-based language.
