# Intro to Snap!

Scratch is the visual programming language introduced in the previous video. It was developed at MIT Labs and is targeted toward the K-12 age group to spark an interest in coding.

Snap!, developed at Berkeley, is also a visual programming language, and modeled after Scratch. But it includes additional features that allow more advanced computer science topics to be taught, while still staying in a visual programming language.

Snap! is being used to teach an introductory computer science course at Berkeley, called [The Beauty and Joy of Computing](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/course/cs10_sp21.html). It is the curriculum from that course which I have used and adapted for this course. We will use Snap! to introduce some basic programming concepts, without having to deal with the complexities of a text-based language.
