What is a function, why are they useful? examples in scratch. Use DRY example.

Combine into one pattern, much simpler to have them all the same size. taking things that are almost the same, but a little different and combining them into one pattern. then you only have to talk about those details that are different in different cases. shipping containers.

draw a square 1" by 1". another a square 2" by 2'. Just create one program to draw a square with an input.

sometimes decide not to generalize patterns. Different sized wiper blades. Smaller on one side. Complicated engineering to work. The cost is two different types adds complexity for installation/repair.

Generally better to abstract.

How does abstraction work in computer programming? Snap! Left menu of things it knows how to do. On the right there is a stage, with a character that carries out the instructions that you tell it to do. There isn't really a cat inside your computer. What there really is are pixels of different colors. What has to happen, when you say to move the cat, you have to erase all the pixels and then draw a new set of pixels someplace else. That happens deep inside Snap!, which is itself a computer program.

Snap! is just a given to you. It is the underpinning that is allowing you to do that programming in that way. It is itself a programming language that relies on another programming language, smalltalk, which is lower level, but still an abstraction....

As far as you are concerned it really is a cat and you can tell it what to do.

If the abstraction is working well, then you don't even think about it as an abstraction. Think about all the things you do with computers, browser, enter a search query and up pops web page. How does it happen? Hugely complicated, but you take it for granted.
