With your partner, grab your deck of cards and make sure it is shuffled well before you start. Then, one of you should, quickly, sort them into ascending order.

A sorted deck will have the cards in the following order:

* A♠
* K♠
* Q♠
* J♠
* 10♠
* 9♠
* ...
* 3♠
* 2♠
* A♥
* K♥
* ...
* 2♥
* A♦
* K♦
* ...
* 2♦
* A♣
* K♣
* ...
* 2♣

Take turns, each of you trying it a few times. Keep track of how long it took you. \(Did you beat [the world record](http://www.recordholders.org/en/records/cardsorting.html)?\)

Think about how fast you could do this if you had the whole class to help. What would your strategy be? As partners, write a detailed description of your strategy. Your teacher will have you share it with the rest of the class. After simply reading your description, your fellow students should be able to act it out! So make sure you are clear in your explanation!

After your fellow student teams have written their strategies, you will choose two of them and make a prediction about how long the card sorting would take. \(Remember how long it took you to card sort alone...\)

#### Get up and do it!

Your instructor will break you up into teams. As a team, pick one of the strategies that was posted in the last activity. Using a watch or cell phone timer, time yourselves. Start when you are handed the randomly shuffled deck and end when you finally have it sorted. \(It might be easier if your instructor, or another student, times you\).

#### Reflect

Discuss with your partner whether it was as perfect as you thought it would be. Where did the problems creep in? Do you think 50 people would do it faster? 100 people? At what point would having more people slow this process down?

With a partner or in a group, please share a non-computer, real-life example in which the serial portion of some task is the smallest \(i.e., embarrassingly parallel\) and is the greatest \(i.e., most difficult to parallelize\).
