## Preparation

You should have completed the [course work from L1]() prior to this lesson.

## Starting Your First Assignment

* **start the assignment** by entering the assignment URL distributed by the instructor in the browser
* **clone the assignment repository** to your local computer
* complete the assignment 
* use Git commands to **save your work and push your changes** to GitHub.

### Start the Assignment

You will receive a link \(URL\) to the assignment from your instructor. Paste the link into a browser. You will be presented with a page like the following.

Clicking on the assignment link will redirect you to the GitHub website where a repository has been created for you. The repository is not within your own GitHub account. It is part of the classroom account for the course.

Notice the name of the repository: assignmentname-username. This allows the instructor to easily find assignments for each student.

VS Code has an integrated terminal window so you can work with the command line interface directly from within VS Code.

### Assignment Content

The assignment repository contains all of the files you need to complete the assignment.

* **README file** - The assignment will always contain at a minimum, a README file, which is what a repo displays as the default file for the repo. It is written in a special language, called [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), which allows the author to add special tags which will format the content to display nicely.
* **Starter Files** - Depending on the nature of the assignment, there may be starter files included in the assignment repo that you will use to start your assignment. The README file will explain what is included and how to setup the assignment with any starter files. For this assignment, there aren't any starter files.

### Viewing the Assignment README file

One of the extensions that we installed was a Markdown previewer. Using this, you can view the README file for the assignment within VS Code. 

Right click on the README.md file in the File Explorer and select **Open Preview**. This will launch a preview of the document in an editor tab.
