# VS Code Intro

## Overview

Visual Studio Code is the source code editor we will be using in the class. It is very popular among web developers. It is very well designed and easy to learn. One of the biggest reasons for its success is that it has a huge library of extensions \(plug-ins\) that can be added to make you more productive.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORrELERGIHs) is a good overview of the core functionalities in VS Code.

## Configuration Settings

Set Git Bash as the default terminal. Follow the directions in this video.

## Popular Editor Themes

These optional extensions supply syntax and background coloring, as well as icons for different file types in the File Explorer View. Just search for themes in the Extensions list and you can browser through some of the most popular ones. Here are a few examples.
