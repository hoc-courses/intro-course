# Guess My Word

## Initialize Word to Guess

First, we're going to create a list of words from which we will randomly pick a word that the player needs to guess.

Here is the [starter project ](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=annechinn&ProjectName=Guess%20My%20Word%20-%20Starter)that contains the list of words.

* create a variable called **word to guess** and initialize it to one of the words in the world-list. Use the **item \[random\] of list** block.
