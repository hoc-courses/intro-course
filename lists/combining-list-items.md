# Combining List Items

Let's say you have a list of numbers, such as all the students' grades on a quiz. You want to find the average grade. There are two steps: First, add up all the numbers; then divide that sum by the number of numbers - that is, by the length of the list.

Notice that the red `length` `of` block that finds the number of items in a list is different from the green `length of` block that finds the number of letters in a text string.

  
Very occasionally you'll define a two-input custom reporter for use with `combine`. The two-input `max` block is an example; try using that to find the largest of a list of numbers.  
****  
We should try out the `average` block. Is that the answer you'd expect?
