# Number Cruncher

Click on this [starter project](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=annechinn&ProjectName=test%20lists%20-%20starter).

Your tasks is to implement each of the list functions below:

There are a series of tests that you should run to make sure all of your functions work correctly.

### Summarizing Numbers <a id="summarizing-numbers"></a>

* Implement the custom SNAP reporter block called "**sum of**" that takes a list as an argument and reports the sum of all the numbers in the list. 
* Implement the custom SNAP reporter block called "**average of**" that takes a list as an argument and reports the average of all the numbers in the list.
* Implement the custom SNAP reporter block called "**max of**" that takes a list as an argument and reports the largest number in the list.
* Implement the custom SNAP predicate block called "**is increasing**" that takes a list of numbers as an argument and reports true if each value in the list is greater than or equal to the one before it.

### Transforming Lists <a id="transforming-lists"></a>

* Implement the custom SNAP reporter block called "**filter less than num**" that takes a number and a list of numbers as arguments and reports a new list that contains only those elements in the original list that are less than the number provided.
* Implement the custom SNAP reporter block called "**reverse list**" that takes a list of numbers and returns a list that contains the same elements, but in the reverse order.
* **Extra challenge**: implement reverse list in-place, meaning that you do not create a new list, but instead replace the items in the list passed in. **hint**: you will need a temporary variable.
