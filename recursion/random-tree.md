# Random Tree

We want to make a tree that looks more random. Here are some pictures of different runs of the program with different levels so that you can see what we were thinking.![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/recur/random-tree1.jpg) ![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/recur/random-tree2.jpg) ![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/recur/random-tree3.jpg)![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/recur/random-tree4.jpg) ![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/recur/random-tree5.jpg) ![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/recur/random-tree6.jpg)

Unfortunately, our attempt \(shown below\) was unsuccessful \(see the ghastly "tree" on the right\). Modify the `crazy-tree` code to produce the random trees as shown above.

To access a copy of buggy code, click on the picture of the block below. You will be redirected to a Google Drive page where you can download the block as an xml file. Once you have done that, open up a [Snap! window](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html), click the file button -&gt; import, and import the crazy tree block file you just downloaded.![import file](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/recur/import_file.png)[![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/lab-10/crazy-tree-buggy-code-snap.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YLPj7Q2sFZe1mkhLpkXFinaBf9cfqa1d/view?usp=sharing) ![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/recur/crazy-tree-fail.png)

Hint 1: Your sprite better end up in the same position and orientation as it was before the call to crazy tree. Hint 2: you may want to create new variables
